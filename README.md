Overview

This project applies advanced SQL techniques to a retail sales dataset previously used in my EDA and ETL projects. By continuing with the same dataset, the analysis demonstrates end-to-end data mastery, from cleaning and transformation (ETL), to exploratory analysis (EDA), and finally to deeper business-level analytics using SQL.

The objective of this phase is to uncover patterns, performance behaviors, and segments that support strong business decision-making across customer behavior, product growth, and operational efficiency.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes:

Order and shipping information

Customer and geographic details

Product identifiers and category data

Sales, units sold, cost, and gross profit

Its structure supports multi-angle analysis, including time-based trends, profitability modeling, and segmentation.

Tools & Technologies

SQL (primary tool for all queries and analysis)

Relational database environment for transformations, calculations, and modeling

Analyses Performed Using SQL
1. Change Over Time Analysis

Evaluated trends in sales, profit, units, and orders across months and years.
This helped identify growth patterns, seasonal behavior, and long-term performance shifts.

2. Cumulative Analysis

Built cumulative metrics such as cumulative sales, cumulative profit, and cumulative order counts.
These metrics provided visibility into progress toward targets and highlighted compounding growth trends.

3. Performance Analysis

Measured operational and financial performance using:

Profit margins

Cost efficiency

Shipping timelines

High and low performing products

Region-level performance

This analysis supported strategic insights into profitability and operational bottlenecks.

4. Part-to-Whole Analysis

Calculated each category, region, customer segment, and product’s contribution to total sales and total profit.
This revealed concentration patterns — which groups drive the bulk of business results.

5. Data Segmentation

Used SQL to segment the dataset into meaningful groups such as:

High-value vs low-value customers

Fast-moving vs slow-moving products

High-profit vs low-profit orders

Regional demand clusters

Segmentation supports targeted marketing, resource allocation, and product strategy.

Key Metrics Generated

Throughout the analysis, SQL queries were used to compute:

Profit margin

Profit per unit

Shipping delay (order-to-ship difference)

Customer lifetime value (CLV-style metric using order totals)

Customer order frequency

Regional sales/profit totals

Category contribution ratios

Cumulative KPIs

These metrics form the basis of insight-driven business recommendations.

Project Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to use SQL not only for ETL and EDA, but also for advanced business analytics. The outputs reveal:

Clear performance trends over time

Strong and weak geographic regions

High-margin vs low-margin product behavior

Customer value tiers

Operational slow points tied to shipping and processing cycles

The insights can directly inform marketing, inventory planning, product strategy, and operational improvements.

Deliverables

SQL scripts for all analyses

Cleaned and transformed dataset (from ETL phase)

Analytical datasets and views

Summary insights for business decision-making
